# 🧹 Startup Cleanup Scripts

This folder contains a set of Windows batch files designed to automatically clean system temp files and browser cache during system startup.

## 🎯 Purpose of These Scripts

The main goal of these scripts is to improve system performance and prevent frequent browser cache-related issues by performing cleanup tasks every time the system starts. These scripts:

- Automatically clean Chrome and Edge browser cache when the system boots
- Remove temporary files from the Windows temp directory
- Clear prefetch files to help maintain system responsiveness
- Reduce issues caused by outdated or corrupted browser cache
- Ensure a smoother experience by preventing slow performance over time

## 🚀 How They Are Used

These `.bat` files are added to the **Windows Startup** directory, so they run automatically when the user logs into the system each day. This helps maintain a clean environment without manual effort.

## 📁 Included Scripts

- **cleanup.bat** – Cleans system temp and prefetch files  
- **open_chrome.bat** – Clears Chrome cache automatically before opening Chrome  
- **open_edge.bat** – Clears Edge cache automatically before opening Edge  

These scripts are simple but effective in preventing common issues caused by accumulated junk files and browser cache.
